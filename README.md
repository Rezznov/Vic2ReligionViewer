# Victoria 2 Religion Viewer

**This tool is no longer being supported. Please see the [Vic2Mapper](https://github.com/Rezznov/vic2mapper) for a tool with the more functionality.**

This program will paint a map of the current majority religion in a province from a .v2 save file.

If you're using a mod that modifies the base game's map, make sure to give the *mod's* map directory, not the base game's.

Works with HPM/HFM and DOD.
